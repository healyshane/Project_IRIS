## Background
Fishers iris data set<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> describes the features from fifty samples from each of three species of Iris, *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*. The features, measured in cm are:
*	Sepal Length
*	Sepal width
*	Petal length
*	Petal width

Fisher created a model to distinguish between the species.

Irisscatter.py imports Iris data set and splits the data of features in lists. These lists are shown in a scatter plot.

Iristoints.py imports Iris data set, splits the data in lists and converts the Iris species names from strings to integers. 
This results in a more consise data set that is easier to analyse. 
The conversion is Iris-setosa  = o, Iris-versicolor = 1 and Iris-virginica = 2.
