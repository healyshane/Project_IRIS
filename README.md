#Background
Fishers iris data set (REF 1) describes the features from fifty samples from each of three species of Iris, Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. The features, measured in cm are:
•	Sepal Length
•	Sepal width
•	Petal length
•	Petal width
Fisher created a model to distinguish between the species.

Irisscatter.py imports Iris data set and splits the data in lists. These lists are shown in a scatter plot.
